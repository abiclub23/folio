    review: "This book kickstarted my journey back into reading—even if it took me over a year to finish, mostly because I bought it, set it aside, and forgot about it for a while. Once I finally got into it, it helped me build new habits and let go of old ones, even though I still struggle at times. It provided a clear framework for moving in the right direction."

The staff engineer role is broad and often vague, differing between companies and teams, but this book helped me define what it means in my context and how to grow from there. As I read, a lot of things clicked-especially around evaluating my work for impact rather than just taking on side quests."

Having read it after years of interest in finance, it reinforced good habits and showed how automating basics gets you most of the way there. It also encourages you to optimize your spending for what matters most to you, rather than just cutting costs everywhere.If I’d read this earlier, it would’ve been a game changer."
