# Annual Birthday Interview Project

## Inspiration & Back-Story

My original idea was to write my kids letters (emails) on each birthday up to their 18th birthday, and then eventually give them access to that email account. I did a decent job for the first few years, but honestly, I lacked the discipline to keep it up. Maybe I'll rejuvenate that project later.

This annual Q&A project is a simpler way to build a time-capsule of memories to look back on as my child grows. Of course, this isn't a novel ideaâ€”many people have done something similar. What finally pushed me to actually do it was [this documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Do_You_Measure_a_Year%3F).

## Goals

- Track how their answers evolve year after year  
- Keep it simple enough that I'll actually follow through each birthday  
- Make it fun for the kids (not too ceremonial or serious)  
- Create something we can both look back on and enjoy

## The Questions

1. How old are you today?
2. What's your favorite toy?
3. What's your favorite song?
4. What do you want to be when you grow up?
5. What makes you happy?
6. What makes you sad?
7. What are you really good at?
8. Who is your best friend?
9. What's your favorite thing you did last year?
10. What would you like to tell your [age] year-old self?


Someday, when my kids are older, hopefully these answers will be as fun for them to revisit as they are for me now. Or at the very least, we'll all get a few good laughs out of it!
