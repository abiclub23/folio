# My Decisions â€“ Should I Buy a Sedan or a Minivan?

## What I Did
I bought a used Honda Odyssey.

## Why I Did It
1. Needed the space when family/friends visit and for short road trips.
2. I was sure I wanted a used car as I didn't want to take on additional loan for secondary car.
3. Another reason for getting a used car was my wife is an amateur driver and was felt comfortable dinging an older car :)

## Outcome/Reflection
1. The Odyssey worked great for family trips. The family is relatively less tired.
2. On weekdays we often have just 1 person in the car, not efficient but that's acceptable for us.
3. We still use my CR-V as the primary family car for errands etc.

## Final Thoughts
Choosing the right vehicle was essential for our family's needs. The decision to go with the Odyssey has worked out well for us.
