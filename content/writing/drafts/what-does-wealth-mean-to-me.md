# What does wealth mean to me ?

I have been learning a lot about personal finance and financal independeces over the past few years. I have often confused wealth with being rich. This confusion probably started at the begning of my career. When the value of my time was less than the money I earned. Which meant i needed to spend more money to get what I want to add "value" to my life.

The definition has changed over the years and will keep evolving.
As any parent know you barley have time for anything, you are always preouccpied with kids. So lets think of time as currency. The hourly rate of my time is very high not from a dollar standpoint but from a "not being present" POV. So i essentially pay to reclaim my time. for eg: get food delivered because it saves me 30mins that I could help my kids with homework. or spending 6 hours assembling an ikea bed when I could use that time to relax or cook some fresh food. 

The other end of spectrum is in my 20s when my hourly rate was quite low . I had time to kill so driving to get food or assembling things were cheaper in context of time x dollars.


Of course this varies for everyone based on your job,income, martial status etc. But I have found it helpful in making so many decisions. Try this exercise, assume your hourly rate is 100/hr (Your salary could be starting point , but usually make it 2x). I recently had a handman fix my toliet flush and few other minor stuff that cost me 200 for an hours work. If i had DIY that it would have taken me atleast twice as that + parts. Making it more expensive than if i just hired a handyman. 

Assuming you are 50/hr Or if u get paid 10k more but it adds an extra hour to your commute , the answer should be no. why ? the time u spend on commute matches to 10k extra. You will be more tired , car will depriceate faster. But peple only tend to look at the dollar value in isolation.

So then what is wealth. First as the popular idiom goes "Health is wealth" , I am in decent helath can do beter in few areas but no chronicle illness or on medication. What else can define it. For me its time.

All this is to say real wealth on most days is just time.

FIRE movement is basically just that, you want to retire , stop working or do what you want. All this means is you reclaim/control your time. But it doesn't have to happen at 1 final day 10years from now , you can reclaim time everyday.

I am fortunate to have a decent income to support my lifestyle. So I can evaluate how to spend my money based on how much time it saves/costs and the dollar amount.

THings that make me feel wealthy

- Slow mornings 
- Not pay attention to price of grocies.
- Having 2 cars.
- Putting my kids in whatever extra ciricular they like
- Vacations
-
