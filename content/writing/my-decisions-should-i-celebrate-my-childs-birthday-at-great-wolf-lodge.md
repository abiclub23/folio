# My Decisions â€“ Should I Celebrate My Child's Birthday at Great Wolf Lodge?

## What I Did
I spent my child's 7th birthday at Great Wolf Lodge.

## Why I Did It
1. Several friends highly recommended Great Wolf Lodge.
2. We wanted a break from our usual trampoline and amusement center parties while also creating a special memory with just our immediate family.
3. After years of organizing elaborate parties (mostly by my amazing wife), we needed a less stressful option.
4. The location was conveniently less than an hour from home.
5. The cost was comparable to previous birthday parties.

## Outcome/Reflection
1. The entire family loved the experience-it was a unanimous hit.
2. The water park was fantastic, but the resort offered much more, including evening dance events and dry-land activities.
3. Staff were exceptional and added to the positive experience.
4. Visiting on a weekday was key-there were virtually no wait times for attractions.
5. The all-inclusive nature of the lodge was perfect-we could play, eat, sleep, and repeat without leaving the premises (and no one had to do dishes!).

## Final Thoughts
Great Wolf Lodge was the right choice for a memorable, stress-free birthday. Book on weekdays to avoid crowds. It's perfect for 7-year-olds and up, while younger children may be limited to the kiddie areas. We'd gladly return.
