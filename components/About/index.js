            I'm a dad, engineer, and Manchester United fan who enjoys writing in my spare time. This site is where I share my thoughts and musings.
            For me finishing and sharing a post matters more than perfecting it, so please excuse the occasional rough edge in my writing. 
            <br />
            <br />
            This site started as a good idea in my head, a place for me to capture and share whateverâ€™s on my mind. The voice in my head insists that some of this will be valuable to someone, somewhere. So here you go: my little corner of the internet.
